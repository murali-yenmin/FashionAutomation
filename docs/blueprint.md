# **App Name**: Image Fusion Studio

## Core Features:

- Background Image Upload: Allow the user to upload a background image, with a default white background if none is uploaded.
- Person Image Upload: Allow the user to upload an image of a person.
- Product Image Upload: Allow the user to upload an image of a product (e.g., clothing).
- AI-Powered Image Fusion: Use generative AI to realistically fit the product image (e.g., a dress) onto the person in the uploaded image. The AI will use the product as a "tool" to guide the image fusion process, adapting to the person's pose and the product's shape.
- Output Display: Display the fused image with the product realistically fitted onto the person.
- Download: Allow the user to download the new fused image.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7BB4E6), evoking creativity and a sense of calm innovation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), to provide a neutral canvas and allow the fused images to stand out.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#9B8FCF), for interactive elements to suggest imagination.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font with a modern and neutral appearance, suitable for all text.
- Use simple, clean icons to represent upload, download, and AI processing functions.
- A clear, sectioned layout for image uploads and output display. The app should have the ability to accommodate a square format for outputs.
- Subtle transition animations to show AI image synthesis in progress, building anticipation.
